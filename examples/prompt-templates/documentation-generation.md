# Prompt Template: Documentation Generation

## TASK

Generate technical documentation for the given code snippet. The goal is to improve maintainability, support onboarding of new developers, and clarify the purpose, usage, and expected behavior of the code.

## CONTEXT

The code below implements a utility function for computing the checksum of a file. The logic is functional but lacks explanation and annotations.

```python
import hashlib

def compute_checksum(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read()
    return hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()
```

## RULES

- Add a docstring for the function using reStructuredText format.
- Include descriptions for parameters and return values.
- Describe the algorithm used and potential edge cases.
- Maintain compatibility with Python 3.x.
- Do not alter the logic unless a bug is detected.

---

The output should be a single, annotated code block including the new documentation. Avoid excessive verbosity and align with PEP 257 standards.
