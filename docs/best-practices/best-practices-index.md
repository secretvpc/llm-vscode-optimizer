# Best Practices Index

This document provides an overview of best-practice modules within the **LLM + VSCode Optimizer** project. These modules present structured recommendations for integrating LLMs into development environments with a focus on maintainability, safety, and productivity.

Each practice is documented as a standalone guide and supports reproducible workflows across tooling, coding habits, and AI-assisted interaction.

## Included Modules

### 1. [AI Integration](ai-integration.md)

Focus:

* Integration models: inline, background, agentic, command-driven
* Practical application in software lifecycle stages (build, test, deploy)
* Risk mitigation: hallucination, overreliance, privacy leakage

Use this guide when designing AI-enhanced processes or introducing LLMs into CI/CD pipelines.

---

### 2. [Productivity Tips](productivity-tips.md)

Focus:

* Daily routines and workflows using ChatGPT or CodeGPT
* Prompt reuse, naming conventions, and ROI tracking
* VSCode shortcuts and session persistence

Use this guide when optimizing flow state, reducing cognitive load, or accelerating iteration cycles.

## Usage Guidance

* Each file follows a structured narrative with sections for rationale, examples, and actionable patterns.
* Practices are compatible with the modular prompt architecture in `examples/prompt-templates/`.
* Guidance may be extended or versioned using `*-guide.md` format.

## File Location

All files are located in:

```
docs/best-practices/
```

This module complements the `docs/workflows/` and `docs/setup/` sections and serves as a foundation for responsible LLM usage in professional environments.

Maintained as part of the **LLM + VSCode Optimizer** documentation suite.
