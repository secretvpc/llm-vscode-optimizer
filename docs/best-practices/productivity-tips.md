# Productivity Tips

This guide offers actionable, field-tested strategies for using AI to boost individual and team productivity in a software development environment.

## 1. Overview

AI productivity is not just about speed—it's about focus, flow, and leverage. Used properly, tools like ChatGPT and VSCode-integrated LLMs can:

* Eliminate repetitive tasks
* Speed up decision-making
* Improve writing and coding precision
* Serve as a second brain during complex work

---

## 2. Daily Workflow Patterns

* 🕐 **Start of Day**: Use ChatGPT to outline daily goals or break down tasks
* 🧠 **Mental Blocks**: Ask AI to explain, reframe, or reword sticking points
* 🔁 **End of Day Recap**: Generate summaries or draft commit messages
* 📋 **Context Transfer**: Copy session context between terminal, editor, and prompt

---

## 3. Coding Productivity Boosters

* 💡 Use AI to stub functions, generate test cases, or refactor old code
* ✂️ Replace boilerplate writing with single-line prompts
* ⏱ Benchmark: Track time saved vs. time used to assess ROI
* 🎯 Apply focused prompts (e.g. "Extract constants", "Convert to async")

---

## 4. Prompt Efficiency Techniques

* 📦 Reuse templated prompts with placeholders
* 🏷 Name your prompt versions: `refactor-v1`, `docgen-light`, etc.
* ✍️ Use structural tags: `TASK`, `INPUT`, `RULES`, `FORMAT`
* 🔁 Use conversational follow-ups: "Make it more idiomatic", "Add logging"

---

## 5. Mental Flow Optimization

* 🧘‍♂️ Reduce cognitive load by using LLMs to externalize memory
* 🎯 Offload syntax recall and boilerplate
* 🔁 Switch between high-focus and exploratory modes via AI prompts
* 🧭 Use AI to quickly validate assumptions or sanity-check logic

---

## 6. VSCode-Specific Tips

* ⌨️ Map hotkeys for common AI commands (`Prompt Selection`, `Explain Code`)
* 📂 Use `.vscode/extensions.json` to load productivity-focused extensions
* 🧠 Keep a side panel open with ChatGPT or CodeGPT for on-demand help
* 📌 Use inline comments to trigger AI: `# generate: logging wrapper`

---

## 7. Best Practices

* Balance speed with comprehension—review generated content
* Don’t multitask AI queries—batch them and revisit
* Archive useful AI interactions for reuse
* Avoid task-switching; use AI to finish one thing before moving to the next

Productivity comes not from using AI constantly, but from using it **strategically**.
