# AI Integration Guide

This module outlines structured practices for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into the software development lifecycle. It identifies common integration models, describes touchpoints within dev workflows, and presents associated risks and controls.

The guide supports responsible and effective use of LLMs for coding, testing, documentation, and deployment.

---

## Purpose

To define reproducible models for integrating LLMs such as ChatGPT into modern development environments in a safe, efficient, and transparent manner.

## Integration Models

| Model          | Description                                    | Example                         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Inline         | Embedded in the editor, contextual suggestions | GitHub Copilot                  |
| Command-driven | Invoked explicitly by user via command         | ChatGPT VSCode extension        |
| Background     | Passive analysis or AI-driven linting          | CI-based YAML/schema validators |
| Agentic        | Multi-step autonomous planning and execution   | LangChain, AutoGPT              |

Use the model appropriate for the task complexity and automation trust level.

---

## Touchpoints in the Dev Lifecycle

LLMs can be applied to:

* Code scaffolding and refactoring
* Inline or batch documentation generation
* Unit test generation and edge case expansion
* Debugging via trace or log summarization
* Commit message synthesis
* Configuration or pipeline generation (e.g. YAML, Docker, CI/CD)

---

## Usage Modes

| Mode    | Role of LLM                      | Use Cases                    |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Passive | Assistive suggestions only       | Refactoring, doc hints       |
| Active  | Executes or rewrites source code | Agentic test case generation |

Toggle modes based on trust, criticality, and team policies.

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                  | Description                                 | Recommended Control                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Hallucination         | Confidently wrong answers                   | Validate with CI/tests                   |
| Privacy leakage       | Sensitive code in prompts                   | Use local models or redact data          |
| Overreliance          | Developer complacency                       | Require reviews of LLM-generated content |
| Version inconsistency | Prompt results differ across model versions | Log inputs/outputs, use fixed templates  |

---

## Recommended Practices

* Version control all structured prompts
* Isolate LLM-driven automation from critical deployment steps
* Log prompt interactions and outputs for reproducibility
* Distinguish between human-authored and AI-generated content
* Provide toggles for user control over AI modes (on-demand vs. continuous)
