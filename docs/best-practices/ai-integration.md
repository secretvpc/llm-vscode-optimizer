# AI Integration

This guide outlines principles and patterns for integrating AI—specifically Large Language Models (LLMs)—seamlessly into the software development workflow.

---

## 1. Overview

AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and CodeGPT can be integrated across the development lifecycle to:

* Accelerate routine coding and documentation
* Reduce cognitive load during debugging
* Enhance architectural planning and code reviews
* Act as a research assistant for learning APIs, libraries, or concepts

## 2. AI Integration Models

| Model          | Description                                  | Example                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Inline         | Integrated directly in editor/code flow      | GitHub Copilot inline suggestions |
| Command-driven | User triggers interaction manually           | CodeGPT with prompt prefix        |
| Background     | Preprocessing or analysis runs automatically | Linting powered by AI             |
| Agentic        | Multistep task planning and execution        | AutoGPT, LangChain agents         |

---

## 3. Integration Touchpoints

AI can be applied to:

* ✍️ Code writing and refactoring
* 📄 Documentation generation
* 🔍 Test case design and validation
* 🧪 Bug triage and reproduction analysis
* 📂 Commit summarization and changelog drafting
* 📊 Dashboard insight commentary (e.g. CI metrics)

## 4. Active vs. Passive Patterns

| Mode    | Role of AI                          | Example                    |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Passive | Contextual support, suggestive only | Inline hints, completions  |
| Active  | Executes or modifies system state   | CLI agents, auto-scripting |

> 🎯 Match the mode to task criticality: passive for core logic, active for automation or batch ops.

## 5. Examples Across Dev Stages

* **Design**: Generate architecture diagrams, API interface suggestions
* **Build**: Translate requirements into scaffold code
* **Test**: Autogenerate unit tests or edge cases
* **Deploy**: Write YAML/CI/CD scripts with schema validation
* **Monitor**: Summarize logs or alert patterns

---

## 6. Risks & Limitations

* 🧠 Hallucinations: Factually incorrect but fluent responses
* 🔐 Privacy: Risk of leaking proprietary code in prompts
* ⚖️ Over-reliance: Skipping domain validation
* 📦 Version drift: Inconsistent outputs with model updates

---

## 7. Best Practices

* Isolate AI actions from critical automation stages
* Always verify outputs before applying them
* Use prompt templates and version control
* Log interactions for audit and reproducibility
* Enable users to toggle between passive/active use modes

---

Effective AI integration treats models as **tools**, not oracles. Design workflows where AI assists but does not silently decide.
