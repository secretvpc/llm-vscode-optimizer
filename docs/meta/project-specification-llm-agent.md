# Project Specification: LLM Agent-Based Development

This document defines the public specification for the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), including ChatGPT Pro+, into the development and documentation workflows of the `llm-vscode-optimizer` project. The specification aligns with current research and best practices in prompt engineering, agent design, and human–LLM collaboration.

---

## Purpose

To formally define the operational structure, agent roles, and behavioral expectations associated with the use of LLMs in the project. This specification is intended for:

* Technical collaborators and contributors
* Auditors or reviewers evaluating reproducibility, transparency, and safety
* Developers seeking to replicate or adapt the framework

## Prompt Design Guidelines

All prompts must follow a structured format for consistency and auditability:

```text
TASK:
  Define the intended goal.

CONTEXT:
  Include relevant code, environment state, or technical data.

RULES:
  Specify formatting, style, syntax constraints, or tool usage.
```

Prompts are maintained and versioned in:

```
examples/prompt-templates/
```

---

## Governance Principles for LLM Use

1. **Transparency**: All prompt interactions must be reviewable.
2. **Reproducibility**: Prompts are versioned and explicitly logged.
3. **Safety**: External API interactions are scoped and validated.
4. **Human Oversight**: All LLM output must be reviewed before inclusion.
5. **Auditability**: Prompt–response pairs must be traceable to source commits.

---

## Licensing and Ethics

The project adheres to the MIT License and upholds ethical principles of LLM usage:

* No proprietary or confidential data is shared with external APIs.
* No autonomous decision-making without human review.
* All LLM-generated content is disclosed and version-controlled.

---

## Maintenance and Change Protocol

* This specification is maintained as a versioned Markdown file.
* Any revision must be submitted via Pull Request with summary rationale.
* This document complements the internal instructional manifest `chatgpt-environment-v2025.md`.
