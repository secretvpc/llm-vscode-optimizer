# Workflow Module Index

This index provides an overview of AI-assisted development workflows included in the **LLM + VSCode Optimizer** project. Each module offers a structured, task-oriented application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real development contexts using Visual Studio Code.

Workflows are modular, reproducible, and aligned with the prompt engineering standards defined in `examples/prompt-templates/`.

## Included Modules

### 1. [Code Generation](code-generation.md)

* Generates functions, configuration files, or boilerplate code
* Leverages structured prompting for reproducible scaffolding
* Supports multi-language output with syntax consistency

### 2. [Debugging with AI](debugging-with-ai.md)

* Uses LLMs to identify, explain, and resolve runtime issues
* Includes workflows for analyzing stack traces and error logs
* Supports refactoring based on root cause analysis

### 3. [Prompt Engineering](prompt-engineering.md)

* Teaches prompt structure and taxonomy: `TASK`, `CONTEXT`, `OUTPUT`
* Demonstrates before/after prompt refinements
* Promotes reusable, version-controlled interaction templates

### 4. [ChatGPT Pro+ as Assistant](chat-assistant.md)

* Describes workflows using browser-based ChatGPT inside VSCode
* No API key required — relies on sidebar and command palette
* Suitable for offline or session-based use with structured prompts

## Usage Guidance

Each workflow document includes:

* Purpose and role in the dev lifecycle
* Example prompt scenarios and transformations
* Recommended extensions and file structure

Use workflows independently or in combination as part of a professional LLM-augmented development pipeline.
